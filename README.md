# AI Summit 2025 Landing Page

## Summary
This project is a modern, dark-themed landing page for the "AI Summit 2025". It features a prominent title for the event, a brief description, and a clear call-to-action with a "Register Now" button.

## Setup
This is a static website, which means it doesn't require any backend server or special setup. To view the landing page:

1.  **Save the file**: Save the `index.html` file to your local computer.
2.  **Open in browser**: Double-click the `index.html` file, or drag and drop it into your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

That's it! The page will load directly in your browser.

## Code Explanation
*   **`index.html`**: This is the main and only file for this project. It contains all the HTML structure, CSS styling, and content for the landing page. The styling is embedded directly in the `<style>` tags within the `<head>` section, making it a self-contained single-page application.
